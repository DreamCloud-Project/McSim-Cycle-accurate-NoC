# McSim - NoC-based platform cycle-accurate simulator

This repository contains a simulator able to simulate embedded applications described using
the [AMALTHEA](http://www.amalthea-project.org/) application model on top of NoC-based architectures in a cycle accurate way.

To get the simulator you must clone this repository and its submodules. To clone the repository if you have an GitHub account with an SSH key registered use `git clone git@github.com:DreamCloud-Project/McSim-Cycle-accurate-NoC.git`. Else use `git clone https://github.com/DreamCloud-Project/McSim-Cycle-accurate-NoC.git`. Then use `git submodule init` followed by `git submodule update` to clone submodules.

## Using the simulator

To ease the usage of the simulator, two python scripts are provided:  

- compile.py for compilation  
- simulate.py for launching the simulation  

The requirements for using these scripts are the following ones:  

- have CMake installed on your system [(https://cmake.org)](https://cmake.org/)
- define the SYSTEMC_HOME variable pointing to a SystemC 2.3.1 root folder
- have the xerces-c-dev library installed in standard includes and libs folders (using apt-get for example)
  or have xerces-c-dev library in a custom folder and define XERCES_HOME

### Compiling the simulator

Compilation is done through the compile.py script which documentation is the following:  

```
TODO
```

### Running the simulator

To run a particular simulation, just run the simulate.py script. By
default this script runs one iteration of the Demo Car application on
a 4x4 NoC using ZigZag mapping, First Come First Serve (fcfs)
scheduling and without repeating periodic runnables.  You can play
with all these parameters which documentation is the following:

```
